As our residents age, we're experiencing increased demand for a continuing care experience. That means more visits from nursing staff, more transportation to appointments—just more people coming in and out of the facility and using our network. Visitors log on to our guest WI-FI and residents have their own network, but I'm concerned about our network security overall. </blockquote> </div> <br>Options <br><blockquote>RESPONSE:Next round<br></blockquote><blockquote>RESPONSE:Branch<br></blockquote><blockquote>RESPONSE:Next round<br></blockquote><blockquote>RESPONSE:Next round<br></blockquote><hr><br> <div> <b>Main!A27</b> </div><br> Customer Text:<div> <blockquote>Interesting.
